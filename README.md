# Image-clasification

Steps:
1.I have used  Scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) to compute the features from images manually.                                                              

2.Stored the sift features in a text file of 5 classes(cat,lion,elaphant,rat)
3.I have used basic knn algothim and euclidean distance to classify the test image.
